# Valentine-Project
💌 Will You Be My Valentine? 💌

A fun, interactive Valentine's Day webpage inspired by the playful energy of Mewtru and CodeKagelHQ on GitHub!(Sorry if messed up the names) This project is a mix of romance, humor, and a bit of harmless emotional manipulation (all in good fun 😈).

🌟 Features

Cute & Smooth UI 🎨 – A pastel gradient background and playful animations to set the mood.

Growing "Yes" Button 🟢 – Every time "No" is pressed, the "Yes" button gets bigger (because love always wins).

Custom Responses 💬 – Inside jokes and funny reactions tailored for that special someone.

Confetti Celebration 🎉 – If they say yes, it’s a party!

Shaking "No" Button ❌ – The "No" button moves when hovered, making rejection nearly impossible.

🛠️ How It Works

Your Valentine is asked the big question.

If they click "Yes", cute animations and confetti rain down. 🥰

If they click "No", the button gets more difficult to press, and the text pleads more dramatically. 😭

Eventually, they give in (hopefully)!
